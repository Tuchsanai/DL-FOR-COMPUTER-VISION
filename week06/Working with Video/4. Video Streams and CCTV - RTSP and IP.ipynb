The underlying protocol used for RTSP is RTP protocol. \n","\n","RTSP was developed by RealNetworks, Netscape and Columbia University around 1996. It a protocol that is used for transferring real-time multimedia data (e.g audio/video) between client and a server. Usually a Client requests and server responds to the request with the data over this protocol. As it is a streaming protocol, with real time capability which means that the data is being simultaneously transferred and rendered in realtime. Here the multimedia data is encapsulated under Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets. So its not RTSP who does the work, its the RTP.
