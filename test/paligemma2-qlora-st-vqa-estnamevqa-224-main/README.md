The repository contains the implementation of fine-tuning PalliGema2 using QLoRA for a specific task. It includes three key Jupyter notebooks: Custom_Dataset.ipynb, which is responsible for preparing and managing the custom dataset; FT_Paligemma.ipynb, which handles the fine-tuning process; and Inf_Paligemma.ipynb, which is used for inference. These notebooks provide a complete workflow for adapting the model to the desired use case.

All this work was described in a post on Medium, which is in this link: https://medium.com/@bernardomotab/ocr-llm-or-multimodal-models-paligemma2-fine-tuning-with-qlora-on-a-custom-dataset-9f50347cac3d
